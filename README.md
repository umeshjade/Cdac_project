IOT-Enabled Smart MedBox for medication Monitoring

ABSTRACT:

Medication non-adherence is a common problem among elderly individuals and
patients suffering from memory-related disorders, often leading to serious health
complications. This project presents an IoT-Enabled Smart MedBox for Medication
Monitoring that ensures timely medication intake and continuous compliance tracking.
The system is designed to provide automated reminders to patients at scheduled
intervals and to monitor whether the prescribed medication has been taken within the
specified time.
The Smart MedBox uses embedded sensors and an IoT-enabled controller to detect
medication access and record intake events. If a dose is missed or not taken within the
prescribed time window, the system automatically sends an alert notification to the
designated caregiver through an IoT platform, enabling timely intervention. All
medication data is logged for monitoring and analysis, improving long-term treatment
adherence.

CONCLUSION :

The IoT-Enabled Smart MedBox is a useful system for helping elderly people and patients with memory problems take their medicines on time. It provides reminders, checks whether the medicine is taken, and sends alerts to caregivers if a dose is missed. This helps reduce health risks caused by forgotten medicines.
The system is easy to use, reliable, and reduces the need for constant manual supervision. By using IoT technology, it allows remote monitoring and improves overall patient safety. This project shows how embedded systems and IoT can be effectively used in healthcare to solve real-life problems.

FUTURE SCOPE:

In the future, the Smart MedBox can be improved by adding a mobile application to send reminders and alerts directly to smartphones. More medicine compartments can be added to support multiple medicines and different timings. The system can also include voice reminders for elderly users who cannot read messages easily. Using health sensors such as heart rate or temperature sensors can help in better health monitoring. With cloud storage and data analysis, doctors can track medicine intake history and provide better treatment.
